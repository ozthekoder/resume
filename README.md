### Profile
Senior Frontend/Full Stack Engineer with 5+ years of experience and a solid computer science background. 
I enjoy building
fast, reliable and scalable web applications that are built with bleeding edge technology, using appropriate design
patterns and best practices.
I am a big fan of [Uncle Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin) and his software development and agile methodologies.
Although started out as a frontend engineer, I have a good understanding of both
LAMP and MEAN stacks and their variations.

### Relevant Experience

#### Shopspring <div style="text-align: right; font-weight: normal; position: absolute; top: 0; right: 0; font-size: 14px">September 2015 – September 2017</div>
-
* Within my first week of employment, I setup my local environment and updated engineering onboarding wiki which was out of date. By the first weekend, I had already started pushing code to production, fixing bugs related to frontend
* Identified the major hiccups in development workflow, proposed solutions for linting, testing, and continuous integration
* Implemented Prettier as a linting solution, added commit hooks that runs only on the changed files which reduced the time it takes to lint and commit code for any Javascript related work by a margin of 15-20%
* Implemented integrations for analytics and ab testing libraries Optimizely-x, Amplitude, and Segment. This involved work on both our Javascript codebase for frontend and Python - Golang codebase for backend
* Implemented a personalization solution for customers to save their measurements and refined our search queries to return only the sizes the customer is looking for as a default
* Made proposals for renewing our frontend stack. Switching from a React - Flux/Redux setup to a React - GraphQL solution
* Switched the unit testing technology used for Javascript from Mocha/Chai to Jest. Added pre-commit hooks to make sure added code meets the standarts for test coverage
* Improved the page load performance by a margin of 40% by implementing optimizations for images, ES6 dynamic imports coupled with webpack code-splitting at component level. Also reduced the javascript compilation and execution overhead by using Web Workers to run Redux state changes and React tree diffing algorithms in a parrallel fashion. 

#### Lifion by ADP <div style="text-align: right; font-weight: normal; position: absolute; top: 0; right: 0; font-size: 14px">September 2015 – September 2017</div>
-
* Worked on breaking down and migrating a large monolith codebase into micro services
* Designed and implemented an attribute based access control system that complies with [XACML](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/3.0/xacml-3.0-core-spec-cs-01-en.pdf) specification
* Took initiative to solve the problem of integration testing between microservices. Created a visual interface for defining chained async operations and a test runner to parse and execute tests in given order
* Created a Docker image that allowed all teams working with ui to run containerized selenium javascript tests on headless browsers. This way we were able to make selenium tests a part of our Jenkins builds
* Designed and coded an intuitive user interface for defining traversals over a graph database using React-Redux and plain SVG
* Created the frontend component for authentication service which involved bootstrapping the boilerplate for a React-Redux application and coding React components for login, sign up, forgot username/password etc features.

#### InRhythm <div style="text-align: right; font-weight: normal; position: absolute; top: 0; right: 0; font-size: 14px">December 2014 – September 2015</div>
-
* __Amplify Education (Client)__ 
	*  Worked on reporting-statistics tool measuring and comparing student academic success and college readiness that's currently being used by all school districts across 13 PARC Consortium states
	*  Implemented interactive React components that was responsible for visualizing student data in graphs and charts as well as a grid structure
	*  Proposed Karma-Jasmine-Istanbul setup for Javascript unit testing as there was nothing being done. Hooked up these technologies into our codebase and iteratively improved unit test coverage up to 90% 
* __Motor Information Systems (Client)__
	*  Identified and fixed frontend related bugs for a .NET – Marionette web application at the last stages of the project. Closed over 500 tickets over 2 months
	*  Updated Marionette, made necessary changes to conform to the new version. Refactored or cleaned up a lot of legacy code
* __InRhythm Labs__
	*  Created a MEAN stack boilerplate that can be used later on other projects
 	* Implemented a web application that was used within the company to track tasks, and task management in order to identify wasted resources
	*  Mentored new hires in best practices.

* Started work as the engineer no 2. Although hired as a frontend engineer, I eventually started operating at a full stack capacity
* Cleaned up legacy code and refactored it to follow a proper MVC pattern
* Implmented a fast and responsive ui for an interactive rich presentation design tool
* Set up a load balancer for Apache server
* Wrote stored procedures, designed tables and relations in SQL, normalized the database. Got rid of security risks of SQL injection
